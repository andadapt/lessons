## Pixels

@ol
- What makes up the image on screen 
- Resolution
- Larger the resolution, larger the image file size

## Bit Depth

@ol
- Increased bit depth allows more colours 
- 32-bit is 4.2 billion colours
- Larger bit depth results in a larger file

## Meta-data

@ol
- Contains additional information about the image
- Resolution, bit depth, even GPS co-ordinates

## Question 1

We have the following two files:

- 2500 x 1200, 2Mb
- 2500 x 1200, 3Mb

Why could the file sizes be different?

## Audio

@ol
- Sound is sampled and stored in digital form
- Sampling size, bit rate and frequency affect file size
@ol

## Compression

Two types of compression

@ol
- Lossy
- Lossless
- Enter in your books as keywords

@ol

[drag=100, drop=center, flow=col]


## Lossy compression

@ol
- Lose information in the compression
- Images such as jpg
- Audio such as MP3
@ol

---
[drag=100, drop=center, flow=col]

## Lossless

@ol
- Don't lose any data in the cimpression
- Good for text, as don't want to lose information
@ol

## Question

What type of compression would be best suited for:

@ol
- Image on the internet?
- A book?
- Streaming internet video?
@ol

## Plenary


Describe the difference between lossy and lossless compression and give an example where each would be used [4 marks]



Metadata
Metadata is data about data - it allows a computer to construct an image. The metadata for an image includes height, width, resolution and colour/bit depth.
