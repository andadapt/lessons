## Starter

ON your MWB answer the following questions, one at a time!

What would the output for the following code be:

```python
for x in range(5,10):
    print(x)
```))
- A - 0 5 10
- B - 5 6 7 8 9 10
- C - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- D - 5 6 7 8 9 

For the Following code what would the output be?

```python
for x in range(0,20,5):
    print(x)
```

- A - 0 5 10 15
- B - 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
- C - 0 5 10 15 20
- D - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

## Python - FOR/WHILE Loops
**ASPIRE TO:** 
Apply a loop to a Python program making them easier to understand

**CHALLENGE TO:** 
Describe how a FOR/WHILE loop might benefit a program

### Iteration Reminder
Iteration is the process of repeating something until a condition is met. 

**Examples are;**
@ol
- FOR loop (Count Controlled)
- WHILE Loop (Condition Controlled)

## Task 1 - Guess the Number

**Your turn!ðŸŽ‰**
Using a new Python window you need to follow the instructions provided in your WHILE Loops Student Workbook.
You need to create a program that checks user entry from an input and if the number entered matches the answer it should say well done you have guessed the number, if it doesnâ€™t it should keep asking for a number to be entered.

Once completed move onto slide 4-8 and screenshot your program

## Progress check

On your

- what would be the last number printed with the following code?

```python
answer = 0

while answer < 3:
    answer = answer + 1
    print(answer)
    
	```

## Task 2 & TAME
Test - Create and test your program on Slide 10 - 12
@ol
- Evaluate - on slide 19 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question.
- Analyse - on slide 13 there is an example program that has been created for you. You should answer the question based on what you see in the code.
- Modify - on slide 14 Read the example exam question and complete the trace table.
- Modify - on slide 16, 17 and 18 you are to read the success criteria and make the program work as it should

## Plenary

what is wrong with the following python code:

```python
while counter < 10:
	print("yipee")
	counter = counter + 1
```



On your MWB write down the last number to be output for the following code:

```python
answer = 0

while answer < 3:
    answer = answer + 1
    print(answer)
    

	```
