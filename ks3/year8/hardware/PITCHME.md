## What is hardware?


Hardware is the physical parts of the computer which you can touch. Hardware that is inside the computer includes:
@ol

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Motherboard
- Graphics Card
- Power Supply
- Hard Drive
- Optical Drive

## Measuring Performance
Hardware components perform in different ways. The CPU performance is measured by its clock speed (Hz), this is how fast it can process data.

RAM is measured by its speed (Hz) and also how much it can store (bytes).

Hard drives are measured by how much it can store (bytes).

There are different units used to show this performance.

## Task
Open the Measuring Performance document.

Put in order fastest to slowest the measurements for clock speed. Then put in order largest to smallest the measurements for storage.

Extension: Complete the questions converting between the different measurements

## Extension
Open the Which PC? document.

For each question look at the four computer specifications and decide which computer is most suitable.

Try to complete the extension questions justifying which computer is most suitable.

## Plenary


- I am the smart part of the computer, I complete all the processing
- Everything connects to me, without me none of the other hardware could work together
- I store large amounts of data permanently, even when the power is off.
- I store data that is being used by the CPU, when the power is turned off, all my information is wiped.
- I can read disks using a laser
- I display the images on your screen

In the chat windowwrite which hardware component I am describing.
